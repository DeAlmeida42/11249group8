Steps to Developing the App:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed https://nodejs.org/en/ and Expo Go installed (search on iOS store).
2. On the command line (note, not the Node.js command line), install Expo CLI globally (or just for your User). It looks like this: (you can ignore the warnings that pop up once installed)
C:\Users\<your username here> npm i -g expo-cli
3. Once complete, clone the repository into some folder locally (an easy way to do this is to make a new VSCode window, clicking on "Clone Git Repository..." under "Start", choosing the branch of the project, and choosing a folder such as C:\Users\<your usernamehere>\Desktop).
Note: You will have to authenticate your Git Profile with VSCode if you have not done so before. Just follow the steps here.
4. Once the repo has been cloned, open it in a VSCode Workspace, then navigate to the 11249\CFarer directory on the terminal (in VSCode --- Click on "Terminal" near the top left of the VSCode window, and click "New Terminal", then type "cd CFarer")
5. Type "npm ci" into the command line to install the node modules (ignore warnings)
6. To run the app, type "expo start --tunnel" into the command line (This will open a browser window)
7. Then scan the QR Code and open the program in Expo Go (make sure Expo Go is the latest update, it will not open otherwise)
8. To close the tunnel, you can press Ctrl+C in the terminal window instance to exit (or just delete the terminal instance)
